### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

Picked *Azure Webapp*

|             | Azure VM    | Azure Webapp |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------  |
| Cost        |  Low       | High        |
| Deployment  | Slow        | Fast        |
| Scalability | Slow, errors prone due to a large numbers of inputs        | One click or automation        |
| Availability  | Monitoring requires some extra service development        | Monitoring is intergrated into Azure eco-system        |
| Workflow  | Working within the VMs most of the time        | Working on the web page with clicks        |
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
I will go from *Azure Webapp* to *Azure VM* if I need a full control on the mhosting machine in case I want to optimize my code and service.
